### Aim
<p>My aim for this final project is to create an arcade game with different sprites and shapes using the OpenGL framework. Currently, the game does not have lighting and has basic features like firing a projectile, moving the player around, and killing the enemy. If possible with further work, the final product would be something similar to Space Invaders but with different levels and environments.</p>
